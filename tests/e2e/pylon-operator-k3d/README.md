# Pylon Operator end-to-end test on k3d

This directory contains an end-to-end test of Pylon Operator with the LLM
gateway stack on a local k3d cluster. `run.sh` installs the
`llm-gateway-stack` and `pylon-operator` charts from this checkout, publishes
an OpenAI-compatible sample backend through an `InferenceEndpoint`, and checks
status, the gateway API and three failure paths. The
[Inference Endpoints quickstart](../../../docs/dev/inference-endpoints-quickstart.md)
walks through the same setup step by step.

## Prerequisites

- A running k3d cluster. `run.sh` does not create or delete clusters. The
  default kube context is `k3d-pylon-op-e2e`, for example from
  `k3d cluster create pylon-op-e2e --agents 1` or `make cluster`.
- `kubectl`, `helm` 3.x, `curl`, and `openssl` or `/dev/urandom`.
- `bash` 3.2 or later. `run.sh` runs with the macOS default bash.
- These images imported into the cluster with `k3d image import -c <cluster>`.
  The test runs every pod with `imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent`.

  | Image | Built from |
  | --- | --- |
  | `docker.io/src/libraries/rust/stargate/crates/stargate:latest` | `bazel run //src/libraries/rust/stargate/crates/stargate:image_load` |
  | `docker.io/src/invocation-plane-services/llm-api-gateway:latest` | `bazel run //src/invocation-plane-services/llm-api-gateway:image_load` |
  | `docker.io/src/compute-plane-services/pylon-operator:latest` | `bazel run //src/compute-plane-services/pylon-operator:image_load` |
  | `docker.io/src/libraries/rust/stargate/crates/pylon:latest` | `bazel run //src/libraries/rust/stargate/crates/pylon:image_load` |
  | `docker.io/library/openai-compatible-sample:e2e` | the OpenAI-compatible sample server from `examples/function-samples/openai-compatible-sample`; it serves `GET /health`, `GET /v1/models` with model `test-model`, and `POST /v1/chat/completions` on port 8000. Build and import it with `make sample-image` |

  For example:

  ```bash
  bazel run //src/compute-plane-services/pylon-operator:image_load
  k3d image import -c pylon-op-e2e src/compute-plane-services/pylon-operator:latest
  ```

  `make images import` builds and imports all five. The Rust images need
  `capnp` in `/usr/local/bin` or `/usr/bin`; see the quickstart.

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
make -C tests/e2e/pylon-operator-k3d test
```

Or directly:

```bash
tests/e2e/pylon-operator-k3d/run.sh
```

To create the cluster, build and import the images and deploy in one go:

```bash
make -C tests/e2e/pylon-operator-k3d cluster images import deploy
```

| Target | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `cluster` | Creates k3d cluster `pylon-op-e2e` with one agent when it does not exist, which also switches the current context to it, then checks that the current context is `E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT`. For an existing cluster it only checks the context. |
| `images` | Runs the four Bazel `image_load` targets and builds the sample image. `BAZEL_FLAGS` adds Bazel flags. `DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR=<absolute path of an empty directory>` adds `--repo_env=DOCKER_CONFIG=...`, so the base images are pulled anonymously when the local `nvcr.io` credential is stale. |
| `import` | Imports the five images with `k3d image import`. |
| `deploy` | Runs `run.sh` with `E2E_DEPLOY_ONLY=1`: setup and the steady-state checks, then prints the port-forward and `curl` commands and leaves everything installed. |
| `test` | Runs `run.sh`. |
| `test-cleanup` | Runs `run.sh` with `E2E_CLEANUP=1`. |
| `test-unit` | `bazel test` of the operator, gateway and Stargate subtrees, with `BAZEL_FLAGS` and `DOCKER_CONFIG_DIR`. |
| `test-charts` | `make test` of the `llm-gateway-stack`, `pylon-operator`, `llm-request-router` and `llm-api-gateway` charts, then `tools/ci/check-helm-charts`. |
| `all` | `images`, `import`, `deploy` and `test`. |
| `destroy` | Prints `k3d cluster delete pylon-op-e2e` and runs it only with `CONFIRM=1`. |
| `sample-image` | Builds the sample image and imports it. |
| `check` | `bash -n`, and `shellcheck` when installed. |

`K3D_CLUSTER` defaults to `E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT` without the `k3d-` prefix.

`run.sh` refuses to run when `kubectl config current-context` differs from
`E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT`, and it passes that context explicitly to every `kubectl`
and `helm` call.

The script prints one `PASS`, `FAIL` or `SKIP` line per assertion and a final
`RESULT: PASS` or `RESULT: FAIL` line. It exits 0 only when every assertion
passed. On a failure it prints the `InferenceEndpoint` YAML, pods, recent
Events and the last 100 log lines of the operator, the Pylon transport pods,
the router and the gateway. A failed setup step or a steady-state condition
that never converges stops the run, and the remaining groups are reported as
`SKIP`.

## What it does

Setup:

1. Generates a cluster token and a caller API key, and computes their SHA-256
   digests. A re-run reuses the token in the credential Secret and the key in
   the work directory; set `E2E_ROTATE_CREDENTIALS=1` for new ones.
2. Creates namespaces `llm-stack`, `pylon-operator` and `models`.
3. Creates Secret `e2e-cluster-credential` (key `cluster-token`) in
   `pylon-operator`.
4. Installs `llm-gateway-stack` in `llm-stack` with `clusterId: spark-e2e`, the
   token digest, one API key digest (id `e2e`), one router and one gateway
   replica.
5. Copies ConfigMap `llm-gateway-stack-ca` into `pylon-operator` and points the
   operator's `trustBundle.configMap` at it.
6. Installs `pylon-operator` in `pylon-operator`, watching `models`, with
   `router.grpcAddress` set to
   `http://llm-request-router.llm-stack.svc.cluster.local:50071`. The router
   serves plaintext gRPC on that port; the QUIC tunnel is verified against the
   stack CA.
7. Applies `manifests/sample-backend.yaml` and
   `manifests/inference-endpoint.yaml` in `models`.

Assertions, each polled for up to `E2E_TIMEOUT` seconds:

- Conditions `Ready=True/HealthProbeSucceeded`,
  `TransportReady=True/PylonConnected` and
  `Registered=True/RegisteredWithRouter`.
- `status.registration.routersConnected` is at least 1, `status.servers` has
  one entry, and `status.observedGeneration` matches the generation.
- `kubectl get inferenceendpoints` shows the columns `MODEL`, `GPU`, `READY`,
  `REGISTERED`, `SERVERS` and `AGE`.
- Through `kubectl port-forward` to the gateway, with TLS verified against the
  stack CA:
  - `GET /v1/models` without a key lists `test-model`.
  - `GET /v1/registry` without a key lists `test-model` as `Healthy`, with
    cluster `spark-e2e`, one registered server and one healthy server.
  - A streaming `POST /v1/chat/completions` with the API key returns 200 and
    Server-Sent Events `data:` lines ending in `data: [DONE]`.
  - The same request without a key returns 401.
- Backend scaled to zero: `Ready=False/NoReadyEndpoints` while `Registered`
  stays `True`. Scaled back: `Ready`, `TransportReady` and `Registered` return
  to `True`.
- `spec.modelName` patched to `wrong-model`: `Ready=False/ModelNameMismatch`,
  the transport Deployment at 0 replicas, and `TransportReady` and
  `Registered` `False/ScaledToZero`. Patched back: the transport returns to one
  replica and every condition to `True`.
- `InferenceEndpoint` deleted: the transport Deployment is garbage-collected
  and `GET /v1/models` no longer lists `test-model`.

At the end the script applies the `InferenceEndpoint` again, so the stack is
left in its steady state for inspection. With `E2E_CLEANUP=1` it instead
uninstalls both releases, deletes the three namespaces and deletes the
`InferenceEndpoint` CRD, which the chart keeps on uninstall.

## Settings

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT` | `k3d-pylon-op-e2e` | Kube context to use. The current context must match. |
| `E2E_CLEANUP` | `0` | `1` removes the releases, namespaces and CRD at the end. |
| `E2E_DEPLOY_ONLY` | `0` | `1` stops after setup and the steady-state checks, prints the port-forward and `curl` commands, and leaves everything installed. It skips the gateway checks and the failure paths, and cannot be combined with `E2E_CLEANUP=1`. |
| `E2E_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds to poll each assertion. |
| `E2E_HELM_TIMEOUT` | `5m` | `helm --timeout` for each install. |
| `E2E_ROTATE_CREDENTIALS` | `0` | `1` generates a new cluster token and API key even when earlier ones exist. |
| `E2E_WORK_DIR` | `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pylon-operator-k3d-e2e` | Generated values files, the CA, the API key (mode 600) and response bodies. |
| `E2E_GATEWAY_LOCAL_PORT` | `18443` | Local port of the gateway port-forward. |
| `E2E_CLUSTER_ID` | `spark-e2e` | `clusterId` of both charts. |
| `E2E_IMAGE_REGISTRY` | `docker.io` | Registry of the four built images. |
| `E2E_IMAGE_TAG` | `latest` | Tag of the four built images. |
| `E2E_ROUTER_REPOSITORY`, `E2E_GATEWAY_REPOSITORY`, `E2E_OPERATOR_REPOSITORY`, `E2E_PYLON_REPOSITORY` | the Bazel image names | Image repositories. |
| `E2E_ROUTER_GRPC_ADDRESS` | `http://llm-request-router.llm-stack.svc.cluster.local:50071` | `router.grpcAddress` of the operator. |
| `E2E_DEV_INSECURE_TRANSPORT` | `0` | `1` sets the operator's `devInsecureTransport`, which skips QUIC certificate verification. |
| `E2E_STACK_NAMESPACE`, `E2E_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE`, `E2E_MODELS_NAMESPACE` | `llm-stack`, `pylon-operator`, `models` | Namespaces. |

## Inspect the cluster afterwards

```bash
kubectl --context k3d-pylon-op-e2e -n models get inferenceendpoints
kubectl --context k3d-pylon-op-e2e -n models describe inferenceendpoint test-model
kubectl --context k3d-pylon-op-e2e -n models logs deployment/pylon-test-model
kubectl --context k3d-pylon-op-e2e -n pylon-operator logs deployment/pylon-operator
kubectl --context k3d-pylon-op-e2e -n llm-stack logs deployment/llm-request-router
kubectl --context k3d-pylon-op-e2e -n llm-stack port-forward svc/llm-api-gateway 18443:8080
```

With the port-forward running, call the gateway with the key and CA from the
work directory:

```bash
WORK="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/pylon-operator-k3d-e2e"
curl --cacert "${WORK}/ca.crt" https://127.0.0.1:18443/v1/registry
curl --cacert "${WORK}/ca.crt" https://127.0.0.1:18443/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat "${WORK}/api-key")" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model": "test-model", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```
