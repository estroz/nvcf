# llm-api-gateway

`llm-api-gateway` is an OpenAI-compatible gateway for routing chat,
responses, and embeddings traffic to NVCF functions through Stargate.

Requests reach this gateway as OpenAI-compatible payloads. The gateway does
not render Hugging Face or Jinja chat templates, does not tokenize prompts, and
does not require LPU vendored modules. Token accounting uses gateway estimates
for admission and routing hints until backend usage is returned.

## Build with Bazel

Bazel is the canonical build path.

```shell
bazel build //...
bazel test //... --flaky_test_attempts=3

bazel build //:image_index
bazel build //:rate_limit_sync_worker_image_index

bazel run //:gazelle
bazel mod tidy
```

Internal push targets are defined under `nvidia-internal`.

## Supported API Surface

The gateway currently serves:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /readyz`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/responses`
- `POST /v1/embeddings`
- `GET /v1/models` and `GET /v1/models/{id}`
- `GET /v1/registry`

`GET /v1/models` lists the models the LLM Request Router can route, in OpenAI
list format and sorted by `id`. A model is listed exactly when
`GET /v1/registry` shows it `Healthy`; both read the same field of one router
listing. It covers only registrations without a routing key. `created` is when
this gateway process first saw the model, so it resets
on restart. `GET /v1/models/{id}` accepts ids that contain slashes and returns
404 for an unlisted model. Both return 502 when the router listing call fails
and the cached listing has expired.

`GET /v1/registry` lists every model the router has registered, routable or
not, sorted by `model`. Each model has a `health` of `Healthy` when any cluster
has `healthyServers` above 0, otherwise `Unhealthy`, and its `clusters` sorted
by `clusterId` with `registeredServers` and `healthyServers` (one server is one
Pylon replica). `generatedAt` is when the gateway fetched the router listing
the response is built from. `?model=<name>` limits the response to one model:
an unlisted name returns an empty `models` list and an empty name returns 400.
It shares the cached listing and the 502 behavior of `GET /v1/models`.

## Request Routing

Each request is normalized into a function-scoped request context.

- `X-NVCF-Function-ID` selects the configured function.
- For chat and responses requests, if the header is omitted, the gateway
  expects `model` to use `<function_id>/<model>` and derives the function id
  from that prefix.
- For JSON inference endpoints, the gateway rewrites `model` to the configured
  downstream model before forwarding to Stargate.
- For multipart endpoints, function selection should be explicit through
  `X-NVCF-Function-ID`; the multipart payload is preserved and the configured
  downstream model is forwarded through headers.
- `Authorization: Bearer ...` is treated as the caller principal for telemetry
  and is forwarded to NVCF gRPC auth when that adapter is configured.
- `X-Request-ID` is accepted if present, otherwise the gateway generates one.
- `X-NVCF-Target-Region` is forwarded into the request context.
- `X-Priority` is reserved for the gateway and derived from the caller's
  resolved priority; a client-supplied `X-Priority` on the LLM endpoints is
  rejected with 400.

Configured functions control the downstream `model`, service tier, routing
method, and per-function rate limits. Prompt rendering and exact prompt
tokenization are not gateway-owned surfaces.

When a request is forwarded to Stargate, the gateway emits routing headers for
the selected function/model and estimated prompt size, including
`x-routing-key`, `x-model`, `x-input-tokens`, and `x-token-estimate`.

For OpenAI-compatible multi-turn stickiness, chat completions and responses
accept `prompt_cache_key` and return the selected session value in
`x-multi-turn-session-id`. Clients can send the same `prompt_cache_key` or
persist the response header and send it on later requests for the same
conversation. The gateway preserves the raw body field for the model backend.
It forwards only a SHA-256-derived value in the internal
`x-cache-affinity-key` header to Stargate.

When `NVCF_GRPC_ADDR` is configured, the gateway authenticates each request
through the NVCF LLM gRPC auth service, derives the per-caller rate-limit key
from `authContext["ncaId"]`, optionally scopes it further by project, and keeps
final token consumption accounting in the gateway after completion or stream
close.

## Prerequisites

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) for pinned tools and task execution

Install the pinned tool versions:

```bash
mise install
```

We use `mise` for both tool installation and task running:

- Tool versions are pinned in `.mise/config.toml`.
- Local tasks live under `.mise/tasks`.
- List tasks with `mise tasks`.
- Run arbitrary commands in the toolchain with `mise x -- <command>`.

## Bootstrap

Install Go dependencies:

```bash
mise run bootstrap
```

## Local Development

Run the gateway with live reload:

```bash
mise run run
```

`mise run run` sources `.env` and then `.env.local` from the repo root when
those files exist.

`mise run run` does not start Stargate. By default the gateway targets
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`. When neither `NVCF_GRPC_ADDR` nor `CALLER_KEYS_FILE`
is set, it sets `ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true`, so callers are not authenticated.

If `RATE_LIMIT_SYNC_TRANSPORT` is set to `pubsub` or `nats`, run the sync
consumer as a separate process:

```bash
go run ./cmd/llm-api-gateway-rate-limit-sync-worker
```

The default local runtime uses:

- `PORT=8080`
- `OLRIC_ENABLED=true`
- `OLRIC_ENV=local`
- `STARGATE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- `NVCF_REGION=local`
- `LOCAL_FUNCTION_ID=default`
- `NVCF_DEFAULT_MODEL=bootstrap-echo`

For chat and responses requests without `X-NVCF-Function-ID`, send the
composite model id `<function_id>/<model>` in the request `model` field. With
the default local config, that is `default/bootstrap-echo`.

Useful overrides:

- `NVCF_GATEWAY_ADDR` to bind a specific listen address
- `NVCF_GATEWAY_MAX_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` to reject larger request bodies with
  413 (default `0`, no limit)
- `STARGATE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT` to control Stargate dial timeout
- `STARGATE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` to cap end-to-end Stargate request time
- `STARGATE_LISTING_CACHE_TTL` to set how long the model and registry
  endpoints reuse one router listing response (default `3s`, `0s` calls the
  router every time)
- `NVCF_GATEWAY_INFERENCE_WRITE_TIMEOUT` to cap how long one response write
  may stall on a client that stopped reading (default `60s`, `0s` disables).
  It applies only while a write is in progress, so long streams, long
  generations, and upstream pauses are not cut off.
- `NVCF_GRPC_ADDR` to enable NVCF gRPC auth. The gateway refuses to start
  without `NVCF_GRPC_ADDR` or `CALLER_KEYS_FILE` unless `ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true`.
- `SECRETS_PATH` for the gateway-to-NVCF secrets file. Use `nvcfApiToken` for
  fixed bearer-token auth, or `id` and `secret` with `OAUTH2_PROVIDER_HOST` for
  OAuth2 client-credentials auth.
- `OAUTH2_PROVIDER_HOST` to enable OAuth2 client-credentials auth when
  `nvcfApiToken` is not present in `SECRETS_PATH`
- `NVCF_GRPC_INSECURE=true` to disable TLS for local gRPC testing
- `NVCF_GRPC_TIMEOUT` to cap each gRPC auth or policy call
- `RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=false` to disable rate limiting locally
- `RATE_LIMIT_FAIL_OPEN=false` to make Olric or limiter failures fatal
- `BARE_MODEL_NAMES_ENABLED=true` to treat the whole request `model` as the
  model name with an empty routing key, for use without the NVCF control
  plane. Such requests skip NVCF auth, and the caller's `Authorization` and
  `X-Routing-Key` headers are not forwarded. Do not enable it where untrusted
  callers can reach the gateway.
- `CALLER_KEYS_FILE` to authenticate callers with static API keys instead of
  NVCF auth (Helm: `callerKeys`). The YAML file lists `keys` entries, each an
  `id` and the hex SHA-256 of a key; it holds no plain keys. Every route except
  `/healthz`, `/readyz`, and `/info` then needs `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
  and returns 401 without a listed key. The key is not forwarded to the
  router, and logs show `api-key:<id>`. The gateway re-reads the file every
  30 s, so added and removed keys apply without a restart; a file that fails
  to load or validate keeps the previous keys and logs an error. It cannot be
  combined with `NVCF_GRPC_ADDR`.
- `ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true` to start without caller authentication and admit
  callers without a key (Helm: `config.allowAnonymous`). The gateway logs a
  warning at startup. It cannot be combined with `NVCF_GRPC_ADDR` or
  `CALLER_KEYS_FILE`.
- `OLRIC_ENABLED=false` to skip starting the embedded Olric node
- `OLRIC_BIND_PORT`, `OLRIC_MEMBERLIST_BIND_PORT`, and `OLRIC_PEERS` for
  multi-instance Olric clustering
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` to override the emitted service name
- `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=otlp|stdout|none` to enable trace export
- `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=otlp|none` to enable metric export

## Metrics

Request-facing metrics include a `function_id` label. The value comes from the
request routing key. Requests without a function, such as health checks, use
`function_id="none"`.

The label is present on HTTP request, upstream request, token usage, provider
time, first-token time, and stream duration metrics. Infrastructure metrics for
authentication, pub/sub, rate-limit synchronization, and Olric remain
function-independent.

Example request-rate query:

```promql
sum by (function_id) (
  rate(llm_api_gateway_http_requests_total[5m])
)
```

Example p95 request-latency query:

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum by (le, function_id) (
    rate(llm_api_gateway_http_request_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
  )
)
```

## Tooling and Tasks

Common tasks:

```bash
mise run build
mise run test
mise run test:all
mise run lint
mise run fmt
mise run kustomize:build:local
```

## Container

Build the container image with `mise run build:docker` or `docker build`.

```bash
docker build -t llm-api-gateway:dev .
```

Run it with the embedded Olric rate limiter enabled:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OLRIC_ENABLED=true \
  -e STARGATE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 \
  -e ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true \
  llm-api-gateway:dev
```

The same image also contains `/usr/bin/llm-api-gateway-rate-limit-sync-worker`.

## Kubernetes

Render the local overlay:

```bash
kustomize build kustomize/overlays/local
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -k kustomize/overlays/local
```

The local overlay deploys the gateway; rate-limit state is kept in embedded
Olric nodes inside the gateway pods. It expects a Stargate HTTP service to be
reachable at `http://stargate:8000`.

To deploy a separate rate-limit sync consumer, add
`kustomize/bases/rate-limit-sync-worker` to your overlay alongside the server
base.

## Before Pushing

Run the standard local checks:

```bash
mise run fmt
mise run lint
mise run test
```
